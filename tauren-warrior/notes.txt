		at 1:05 not sure if /exit kept the time running
		at least 2 minutes extra time was added from doing /exit, meaining we beat that other record
			but maybe we are faster with the 2h axe

36 mins lvl 7 by getting to level 4 before returning from first quest outing and grabbing battle shout
	- bad because too much grinding



end of run quest turn ins at lvl 9: 3480xp
	rite of vision (772): 480xp
	dangers of the windfury: 700xp
	dwarven digging: 700xp
	thunderhorn cleansing: 700xp
	the demon scarred cloak: 900xp
so we must be at 3020/6500xp to ding optimally
