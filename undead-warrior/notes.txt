1063 xp, no letter to yvette (480 xp). after turnins we have 6193. missing 307 xp. so should either wait till 1370xp, or do the run that gives 200, and then another 360 on the way back, and it takes 2 minutes ish for the 560xp

9+1370xp -> no letter to yvette
    9+1170xp -> run for return to magistrate
    9+810xp -> with run back
9+890xp -> with letter to yvette
    9+690xp -> run for return to magistrate
    9+330xp -> with run back

5 minute xp check. starting at 407. ended at 1491. how many xp is that per minute?
	217 per minute (but we could get the letter!)


TODO
	- i think that we will see more speed by doing gouls last, but this requires a routing change when we hearth back from pumpkins

sell after hearthing
dont bother with chill of death
accepting fields of grief so we dont think we need it (nvm we do need it its just not working

accept putrid task on the way out

wow i was really over the xp mark this time. had decent rng for everything too. if we skipped gordo stuff we would be good (230xp + 530xp)

get enough xp to not have to turn in a putrid task / accept mills overrun


calculations are off from doom weed


TODO START HERE
should farm till 410xp over beofre heaarthing so putrid task

TODO
at the start before level 2, kite 2 mobs to the quest givers instead of only 1

TODO
look into timing the patrol of the road guy in and out to get his help

TODO
we can probably loot less in certain areas?
	not if they drop scrolls of stam/prot/spirit, so just the beasts if its not needed for a quest

TODO 
loot the chests, maybe get a weapon... so do rothides first?
chest in undead starting is bad but near brill could be good
